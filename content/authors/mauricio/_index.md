I am a PhD student at the Department of Ecology of the São Paulo State University, São Paulo, Brazil. My research is focused in understand the spatial pattern of amphibian communities distribution in the Atlantic Forest Biome.

I have interested in statistics, geocomputation, spatial ecology, quantitative ecology, species distribution models, landscape ecology, and amphibiam ecology.

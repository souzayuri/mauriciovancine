I'm a Doctoral Student at the [Department of Biodiversity](https://ib.rc.unesp.br/#!/departamentos/ecologia/) of the [São Paulo State University](https://ib.rc.unesp.br/#!/), Rio Claro, Brazil. I have interested in spatial ecology, landscape ecology, quantitative ecology, species distribution models (SDMs), amphibian ecology, statistics, and geocomputation
